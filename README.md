## A wrapping list of divs

This displays a clean looking "list" of divs. Each div contains a name. The div has padding to create a little box around each name, a margin to separate it from the other divs, and stylish rounded borders.

When the page is resized, the divs wrap to the next row, if needed.

Here's what it looks like right now!
