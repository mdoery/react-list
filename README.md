## A wrapping list of spans

This displays a clean looking "list" of spans. Each span contains a name. The span has padding to create a little box around each name, a margin to separate it from the other spans, and stylish rounded borders.

When the page is resized, the spans wrap to the next row, if needed.

Here's what it looks like right now!
